# Image Processing and Modeling Toolkit

This project is a comprehensive suite of tools designed for various image processing tasks including augmentation, cropping, grayscaling, and a set of operations related to modeling. The toolkit is structured around a Python-based application (`app.py`) that serves as the entry point to use the four individual scripts:

- **augumentation.py**: For image augmentation operations.
- **cropping.py**: To crop images to specified dimensions.
- **grayscaling.py**: For converting images to grayscale.
- **modeling.py**: To control our model operations such as training, evaluating, and applying the model to predict wear of cutting tools for milling machines.
- **segmentation.py**:
- **wear_measurement.py**:

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure that Python 3.x is installed on your system. The scripts also require additional libraries, details of which can be found in the `requirements.txt` file. Install the required Python libraries using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

or use conda 

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

### Installation

Clone the repository or download the source code to your local machine. Ensure all scripts (`augumentation.py`, `cropping.py`, `grayscaling.py`, `modeling.py`, and `app.py`) are in the same directory, or adjust the paths in `app.py` accordingly.

### Running the Application

Navigate to the project directory and run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
python app.py
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to select the desired operation and provide necessary inputs as requested.

## Features

1. **Image Augmentation**
   - Perform various image transformations like rotation, scaling, and flipping to augment your image dataset.

2. **Image Cropping**
   - Crop images to a specified width and height.

3. **Image Grayscaling**
   - Convert color images to grayscale, optionally categorizing pixel values into classes.

4. **Model Operations**
   - Manage operations related to a machine learning model, including training, loading, evaluating, and making predictions.

## Usage

Upon launching `app.py`, you will be presented with a menu to choose from the following options:

1. **Image Augmentation**: Enter paths for input and output directories.
2. **Image Cropping**: Provide input and output directory paths along with the desired dimensions for cropping.
3. **Image Grayscaling**: Specify the directories for reading and writing grayscale images.
4. **Model Operations**: Choose from loading, training, or evaluating the model, and provide necessary paths (images folder and masks folder). When you just use the package, after you initiation ```model = WearDetector()``` you should call ```model.load_data()``` function for training the model (both of ```model.train()``` and ```model.grid_search_train()```). And use ```model.evaluate(X,y, verbose=1)``` and ```model.predict( images_dir, verbose=0)``` for evaluation and prediction base on the dataset you give (X,y as well as images_dir).
